Description

Library Management System is a simple application designed to help library managers efficiently manage library data. It allows librarians to add/remove books and members, rent books, track borrowing activities, and ensure timely returns. The system stores all the data in a JSON file for easy access. This project is created to demonstrate the fundamentals of programming, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), and Python, and it was developed as part of the CS305 Programming Languages course.
